        Tips and Notes
        Note: <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element.

        Note: Metadata is always passed as name/value pairs.

        Note: The content attribute MUST be defined if the name or the http-equiv attribute is defined. If none of these are defined, the content attribute CANNOT be defined.

        Setting The Viewport

        HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.

        The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

        You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

        The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

        The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

        Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:
    -->

    <meta charset = "UTF 8">
    <meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width", initial-scale = 1.0>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content = "ie-edge">
    <title> Document </title>
</head>
